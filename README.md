# LogyText Interview Task

This is a simple To-Do SPA written with React and Material UI. It uses Context in combination with useReducer for state management and persists the items in local storage. It supports only two types of functionality - adding and removing items from a list.

Currently, each time a task is completed it gets deleted from the store. Your task is to extend this application with the functionality to display completed tasks. Instead of deleting items when they're done, we should display them in a separate list. This can be done in a list on the same page or in a separate page, whatever approach you like best.

You should accomplish this by extending the existing application, not rewriting large parts of it. We expect you to spend no more than 2 hours on the task and we know that this is not enough for a perfect production quality solution. We're not looking for one, instead we're interested in seeing the trade-offs that you will make and your ability to work with an existing codebase.

### Bonus Task

The boy scouts have a famous principle - leave things better than the way you found them.

While you are implementing the functionality from the task, feel free to improve anything about the design and structure of the application that you don't like. For example, if you don't like how the logic is split in files, move it around. If you don't like the structure of the application, reorganize it.

We're interested in learning both about your techical knowledge and your opinions about React development.

### Good Luck!
